	       I've always been fascinated by Information Technology, especially platform and infrastructure, and am 
	       excited about the explosive success of the Public Cloud and the advent of IoT, PaaS and Serverless Computing. 
	       I was fortunate to have spent much of my career working for Sun Microsystems so had a front row seat 
	       during the shift to networking computing, development of the WWW, Java and commercialization of the Internet. 
	       Those were exciting times for sure and layed groundwork for the mass disruption and accelerated innovation 
	       we're seeing today with DevOps, Containers and Hybrid Multi-Cloud technologies. Change is the only constant.

	       <br><br>

	       I'm CISSP 
	       <A HREF="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/e1ff6367-84dd-434f-9a3d-41ace4ea230d/linked_in_profile">
	       Certified</A>, 
	       AWS Solution Architect Associate
	       <A HREF="http://portfolio.mikeoc.me/docs/AWS+Certified+Solutions+Architect+-+Associate+certificate.pdf">
	       Certified</A> and am currently working on AWS Certified Developer. It's been years since I was a
	       full-time developer but think it's important as an IT sales professional to keep my hands 
	       dirty and have a grounded understanding of how things actually work. I still use vi(m) and these days work 
	       primarily in Python.  I prefer OSX and Linux for development having been
	       a BSD UNIX guy since my early days in the <A HREF="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">Purdue ECE</A> 
	       lab. I enjoy hacking small single-board linux based computers (<A HREF="http://getchip.com">CHIP</A>, 
	       Raspberry Pi) and integrating home automation devices using services such as Lambda, Yonomi and IFTTT.
	       I currently have a mix of Ring, Wink, Lifx, Echo, Wemo, Sonos, AWS Button, GE and Lutron.

               <br><br>

	       For fun I also enjoy travel, running, yoga, riding my R1200 RT as well as playing and promoting 
	       <A HREF = "http://segpolo.org/">Segway
	       Polo</A>. Yes, that's really a thing.
